    "We were not able to fit a good model. Both SVR and linear regression had negative r2 values which meant that they were worse at predicting than just guessing with a horizontal line. Our ANN model was positive but had an r2 value of 0.0122 which is extremely low and not useful for any analysis. In order to improve our models we would do the following:\n",
    "* more parameter optimization\n",
    "* try other models (xgboost)\n",
    "* collect more data\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that the reason why our models were so weak is because of external data we were missing. For example, fire fighter response to the fires is most likely one of the greatest factors. If the data for area burnt was based on if the forest burned without human intervention, the models would likely be more accurate."
